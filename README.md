# Histograph configuration file

All Histograph modules use a single configuration file, `histograph.json`, and expect the `HISTOGRAPH_CONFIG` environment variable set to its path.

First, copy `histograph.example.json` to `histograph.json`, then modify values to your wishes, and finally,

```bash
export HISTOGRAPH_CONFIG=/Users/bert/code/histograph/config/histograph.json
```
